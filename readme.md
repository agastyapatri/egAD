#   egAD! 
A simple scalar valued autodifferentiation engine written in C. 


**TODO** 

1.  Write the topological sorting algorithm for unsorted graphs  
2.  Right now, the nodes are being added to the graph manually; figure out a way to trigger graph initialization + population when any scalar operations are done
