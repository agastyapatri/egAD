#   egAD! 
A simple scalar valued autodifferentiation engine written in C. 


**TODO** 
1.  Write the topological sorting algorithm for unsorted graphs  
2.  add more ops to `OPTYPE`
3.  write more tests for complicated math.
4.  look at the structure of `HIPS/autograd` to get inspiration
5.  look into how a graph can be implemented as an arena allocator, and the different nodes attached to it would just be pointers being assigned to it.
